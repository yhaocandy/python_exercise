Whining and grumbling implies two things ¡ª one, that we are victims, and two, there are no solutions to our problems. Rarely does an emotionally intelligent person feel victimized, and even more infrequently does an emotionally intelligent person feel that a solution is beyond their grasp. Instead of looking for someone or something to blame, they immediately think of how to constructively address the dilemma. They also know that their complaints influence the emotional responses of those around them, and instead search for ways to bemoan the dissolution of a relationship or a disappointment with a friend in private, effective ways ¡ª whether it¡¯s taking a yoga class, meditating alone at a park, or simply getting their feelings out on the page.blame blame blame blame blame blame blame blame blame blame blame blame
