Like empathy, self-control and conviction are sure signs of an emotionally solid person. Emotionally intelligent people are well-aware that a second glass of wine will lead to negative consequences the next morning, just as they know that an invitation to go on a spontaneous weekend rendezvous will detract them from fulfilling their preexisting commitments. They are definitive about their decisions, rather than saying ¡°I don¡¯t know, maybe?¡± or ¡°Perhaps I¡¯ll skip the gym today,¡± which invites doubt ¡ª and with that, heightened anxiety, even depression.
The more often emotionally intelligent people exercise their right to say no, and the more frequently they rely on their willpower, the freer they are to concentrate on their ambitions and overall well-being.intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent
