One of the hallmarks of Emotional Intelligence is empathy, and those with high EQs extend it to everyone they cross. But there¡¯s an enormous difference between displaying empathy towards a friend or loved one and allowing another person¡¯s rage or misery to incense, dominate, or merely influence one¡¯s well-being. Think of the histrionic behavior of your co-worker who is ¡°distraught¡± not because she¡¯s going through a break-up but because her friend is. Or that cousin of yours who, instead of focusing on her individual personal crises, purposefully seeks out people who are distressed so that her problems disappear via distraction ¡ª a habit so ingrained she can¡¯t seem to address her the complications in her own life.

Emotionally intelligent people, on the other hand, listen carefully, provide gentle, loving, but authoritative advice, and offer assistance. But they don¡¯t permit others¡¯ lives and reactions to rule their own. people people people people people people people people people
